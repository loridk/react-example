/*
In the following code, we are fetching data in our Home component and displaying it.

We will use the JSONPlaceholder service to fetch fake data. This service is great for testing applications when there is no existing data.

To learn more, check out the JavaScript Fetch API section.

Use the JSONPlaceholder service to fetch fake "todo" items and display the titles on the page:

/*
Example explained:

We have created a new file called useFetch.js containing a function called useFetch which contains all of the logic needed to fetch our data.

We removed the hard-coded URL and replaced it with a url variable that can be passed to the custom Hook.

Lastly, we are returning our data from our Hook.

In index.js, we are importing our useFetch Hook and utilizing it like any other Hook. This is where we pass in the URL to fetch data from.

Now we can reuse this custom Hook in any component to fetch data from any URL.

// useFetch.js
import { useState, useEffect } from "react";

const useFetch = (url) => {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch(url)
      .then((res) => res.json())
      .then((data) => setData(data));
  }, [url]);

  return [data];
};

export default useFetch;

// index.js
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import useFetch from "./useFetch";

const Home = () => {
  const [data] = useFetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos");

  return (
    <>
      {data &&
        data.map((item) => {
          return <p key={item.id}>{item.title}</p>;
        })}
    </>
  );

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<Home />);
